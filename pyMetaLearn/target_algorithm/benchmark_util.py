def parse_cli():
    """
    Provide a generic command line interface for benchmarks. It will just parse
    the command line according to simple rules and return two dictionaries, one
    containing all arguments for the benchmark algorithm like dataset,
    crossvalidation metadata etc. and the containing all learning algorithm
    hyperparameters.

    Parsing rules:
    - Arguments with two minus signs are treated as benchmark arguments, Xalues
     are not allowed to start with a minus. The last argument must --params,
     starting the hyperparameter arguments.
    - All arguments after --params are treated as hyperparameters to the
     learning algorithm. Every parameter name must start with one minus and must
     have exactly one value which has to be given in single quotes.

    Example:
    python neural_network.py --folds 10 --fold 1 --dataset convex  --params
        -depth '3' -n_hid_0 '1024' -n_hid_1 '1024' -n_hid_2 '1024' -lr '0.01'
