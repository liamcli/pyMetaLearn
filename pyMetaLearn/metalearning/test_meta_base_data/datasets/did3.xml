	<oml:description>1. Title: Chess End-Game -- King+Rook versus King+Pawn on a7
    (usually abbreviated KRKPA7).  The pawn on a7 means it is one square
    away from queening.  It is the King+Rook's side (white) to move.

 4. Relevant Information:
       The dataset format is described below.  Note: the format of this
     database was modified on 2/26/90 to conform with the format of all
     the other databases in the UCI repository of machine learning databases.
 
 5. Number of Instances: 3196 total
 
 6. Number of Attributes: 36
 
 7. Attribute Summaries:
     Classes (2):  -- White-can-win (&quot;won&quot;) and White-cannot-win (&quot;nowin&quot;).
           I believe that White is deemed to be unable to win if the Black pawn
           can safely advance.
     Attributes: see Shapiro's book.
 
 8. Missing Attributes: --  none
 
 9. Class Distribution:
     In 1669 of the positions (52%), White can win.
     In 1527 of the positions (48%), White cannot win.
 
 The format for instances in this database is a sequence of 37 attribute values.
 Each instance is a board-descriptions for this chess endgame.  The first
 36 attributes describe the board.  The last (37th) attribute is the
 classification: &quot;win&quot; or &quot;nowin&quot;.  There are 0 missing values.
 A typical board-description is
 
 f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,l,f,n,f,f,t,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,t,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,t,t,n,won
 
 The names of the features do not appear in the board-descriptions.
 Instead, each feature correponds to a particular position in the
 feature-value list.  For example, the head of this list is the value
 for the feature &quot;bkblk&quot;.  The following is the list of features, in
 the order in which their values appear in the feature-value list:
 
 [bkblk,bknwy,bkon8,bkona,bkspr,bkxbq,bkxcr,bkxwp,blxwp,bxqsq,cntxt,dsopp,dwipd,
  hdchk,katri,mulch,qxmsq,r2ar8,reskd,reskr,rimmx,rkxwp,rxmsq,simpl,skach,skewr,
  skrxp,spcop,stlmt,thrsk,wkcti,wkna8,wknck,wkovl,wkpos,wtoeg]
 
 In the file, there is one instance (board position) per line.
